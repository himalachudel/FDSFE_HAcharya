# FDSFE_HAcharya
I am a first-year PhD student from the Department of Plant and Soil Sciences at CANR, University of Delaware. If not in the lab or doing academia, you might see me hiking, reading books, or cooking delicacies.
The reason for choosing to join this class is to get a basic understanding of Coding, Python, AI, and ML which would be needed in my Ph.D. dissertation project.
I hope to be able to code using Python on my own, understand the basics of AI and ML right, and start building from there.
I have brief experience with other programming languages R, so I feel like I would be learning relatively quickly
