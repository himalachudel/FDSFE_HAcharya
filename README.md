# FDSFE_HAcharya
The reason for choosing to join this class is to get a basic understanding of Coding, Python, AI, and ML which would be needed in my Ph.D. dissertation project.
I hope to be able to code using Python on my own, understand the basics of AI and ML right, and start building from there.
I have brief experience with other programming languages R, so I feel like I would be learning relatively quickly
