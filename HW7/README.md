**1. I have attached two graphs; one bad and one good in terms of how they are plotted and whether or not they are following simple norms of data visualization. The good graph is taken from https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(22)00017-4 and the bad graph is taken from https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.8b19251.**




**Bad Graph**

<img width="1301" alt="Screenshot 2023-11-14 at 9 13 43 AM" src="https://github.com/himalachudel/FDSFE_HAcharya/assets/144074437/d300576a-597f-4be2-8df4-1b213af2a0fa">

**Reasons for the graph being bad**

- Distortion: Expression of data in 3D format is making it look messy and misleading to some extent
  
- Distraction: Fitting in too many variables and too many colors in a single graph
  
- Ambiguity: Unevenly spaced axes. The voltage axis has 0.2 spacing and 0.1 spacing at equal 
  distances. The same is the case for the Flowing Rate axis.
  
- Ambiguity: The bar height exudes a false impression on viewers. 2.9 V bar is 2-3 times 
  taller than 2.0 V bar. Similarly, 316 mL/min bar is as tall as 0 mL/min bar.


The Tufte's 5 rules are violated in the following ways:

- Effect size ~ 1: Effect size is not ~1 in most of the situations because the height of bars doesn't agree with the numerical values 
  assigned with them

- Data/ink >> 1: Use of more than necessary ink.

- No chart junk: The chark looks junk because of the 3D graphical expression

- Use small-multiples: The data is not time series so this rule doesn't apply here.
  
- Avoid redundancy in communication: The use of different colors for different flow rates is not necessary.






**Good Graph**

**Reasons for the graph being good**

- Use of minimal colors, just enough to separate between variables, and don't make it 
  look complicated at the same time (No distraction)

- Evenly spaced axes (No distortion)

- No disagreement between the heights/lengths of the bars/lines and their 
  corresponding numeric values (No ambiguity)
  
- Well-labeled axes with units











**2. Following are the two graphs from past homework. The old graph is the one that was submitted as homework and the new one is after making some changes.**

**Old Graph**

The changes made in the old graph are:
- The legend title was missing earlier which is now corrected
- The label of the Y axis was oriented at 45 deg which made it visually less aesthetic. It is now oriented at 0 deg
- The title of the graph was missing earlier which is corrected now

**New Graph**
