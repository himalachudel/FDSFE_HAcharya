The reason for choosing to join this class is to get basic understanding of Coding, Python, AI, ML which would be needed in my PhD dissertation project
I hope to be able to code using python on my own, understand basics of AI and ML right and starting building from there
I have brief experience with other programming language R, so I feel like I would be learning relatively quick
