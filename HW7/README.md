I have attached two graphs; one bad and one good in terms of how they are plotted and whether or not they are following simple norms of data visualization. The good graph is taken from https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(22)00017-4 and the bad graph is taken from https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.8b19251





**Bad Graph**

**Reasons for the graph being bad**

- Expression of data in 3D format is making it look messy
  
- Fitting in too many variables in a single graph
  
- Use of many colors
  
- Unevenly spaced axes. The voltage axis has 0.2 spacing and 0.1 spacing at equal 
  distance. The same is the case for the Flowing Rate axis.
  
- The bar height exudes a false impression on viewers. 2.9 V bar is 2-3 times 
  taller than 2.0 V bar. Similarly, 316 mL/min bar is as taller as 0 mL/min bar.





**Good Graph**

**Reasons for the graph being good**

- Use of minimal colors, enough to separate between variables and not don' make it 
  look complicated at the same time

- Evenly spaced axes

- Well-labeled axes with units

- No disagreement between the heights/lengths of the bars/lines and their 
  corresponding numeric values
